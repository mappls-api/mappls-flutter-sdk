# Map Gestures

The Mappls Maps Flutter SDK allows you to define interactions that you can activate on the map to enable gestures and click events. The following gestures are supported :

### [Target]()

The target is single latitude and longitude coordinate that the camera centers it on. Changing the camera's target will move the camera to the inputted coordinates. The target is a LatLng object. The target coordinate is always  _at the center of the viewport_.

### [Tilt]()

Tilt is the camera's angle from the nadir (directly facing the Earth) and uses unit degrees. The camera's minimum (default) tilt is 0 degrees, and the maximum tilt is 60. Tilt levels use six decimal point of precision, which enables you to restrict/set/lock a map's bearing with extreme precision.

The map camera tilt can also adjust by placing two fingertips on the map and moving both fingers up and down in parallel at the same time or

### [Bearing]()

Bearing represents the direction that the camera is pointing in and measured in degrees  _clockwise from north_.

The camera's default bearing is 0 degrees (i.e. "true north") causing the map compass to hide until the camera bearing becomes a non-zero value. Bearing levels use six decimal point precision, which enables you to restrict/set/lock a map's bearing with extreme precision. In addition to programmatically adjusting the camera bearing, the user can place two fingertips on the map and rotate their fingers.

### [Zoom]()

Zoom controls scale of the map and consumes any value between 1 and 22. At zoom level 1, viewport shows continents and other world features. A middle value of 11 will show city level details.At a higher zoom level, map will begin to show buildings and points of interest. Camera can zoom in following ways:

-   Pinch motion two fingers to zoom in and out.
-   Quickly tap twice on the map with a single finger to zoom in.
-   Quickly tap twice on the map with a single finger and hold your finger down on the screen after the second tap.
-   Then slide the finger up to zoom out and down to zoom out.
